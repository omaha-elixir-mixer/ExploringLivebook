To get up and running with Docker:

1. Make sure Docker is installed on your machine, and also running
2. Run `docker-compose build` to build the image for the Phoenix app
3. Run `docker-compose run phoenix mix setup` to install dependencies and set up the database
4. Run `docker-compose up` to start Livebook, the Phoenix Demo App, and the Postgres database
5. Check the console to get the URL that Livebook is running on with the unique token.  It will look something like this:
