# What is Livebook?

* A "tool for creating **interactive** and **collaborative** code notebooks" ([From livebook.dev](https://livebook.dev/#install))
* An open source Elixir web application built with [Phoenix LiveView](https://www.phoenixframework.org)
* Sometimes also used to refer to the notebooks themselves, though this is not technically correct and causes confusion

---
# What is a Livebook Notebook?

* "documents that mix text, code, and rich output"
* stored as a `.livemd` file that can be shared, version controlled, and opened/edited with any text editor
* Example: [Exploring Livebook](https://github.com/omaha-elixir-mixer/ExploringLivebook/blob/main/notebooks/exploring_livebook_volume_one.livemd)

---
# Use Cases

Basic
* Experimenting, rapid prototyping, coding along
* Curriculum development and delivery
* Interactive code documentation

Advanced
