## Principle of Approachability

When creating new content for the training, please keep in mind the overarching principle of this curriculum which is to make it friendly for everyone. All skill levels and walks of life should feel like they can participate in this training and learn something from it. 

What it means to actually make your added content "approachable" can be a bit subjective and the maintainers of the repository will do their best to review submissions with a critical eye and provide actionable feedback on adjustments to make to keep a uniform voice and encourage approachability.

## Providing Sources

Regardless if you are merely suggesting a new topic for a lesson or a module, please provide reputable sources to back up the assertion that what you are sharing is accurate. In the case of opening an issue as an idea for discussion, it also helps whoever picks up the issue with good resources to start with to create the content.

## Markdown Styling

Please refrain from using complex HTML markdown in favor of traditional markdown styling when possible. It is understandable that some elements just are not supported in basic markdown and *require* HTML - in those cases, it will be premitted.
